This repository contains all the new features introduced in detail. As the name suggest , the Java8 features were never defined in such detail on any blog or website. I have gathered them in a pieces and make this gem. So let's enjoy it .

# Lambda Expression

Lambda Expression is just an anonymous (nameless) function. That means the function which
doesn’t have the name, return type and access modifiers. Lambda Expression also known as anonymous functions or closures.

```java
public void m1() {
 sop(“hello”);
}
```
The above method can be written as below in lambda expression :

```java
() -> {
 sop(“hello”);
 }
 
() -> { sop(“hello”); }

() -> sop(“hello”);
```

**Example 2:**

```java
public void add(inta, int b) {
 sop(a+b);
}
```
can be written as 

```java
(inta, int b) -> sop(a+b);
```

If the type of the parameter can be decided by compiler automatically based on the context then
we can remove types also.The above Lambda expression we can rewrite as 

```java
(a,b) -> sop (a+b);
```

## Important points about lamba expression

1. A lambda expression can have zero or more number of parameters (arguments).

Example

```java

- () -> sop(“hello”);
- (int a ) -> sop(a);
- (inta, int b) -> return a+b;
```
2. Usually we can specify type of parameter. If the compiler expects the type based on the context
then we can remove type. i.e., programmer is not required.

```java
(inta, int b) -> sop(a+b);
 ```
can be written as ```java (a,b) -> sop(a+b); ```

3. If multiple parameters present then these parameters should be separated with comma (,).
4. If zero number of parameters available then we have to use empty parameter **[ like ()]**.
```java
Ex: ()  sop(“hello”);
```
5. If only one parameter is available and if the compiler can expect the type then we can remove the
type and parenthesis also.

```java 
(int a) ->  sop(a);
above can e written as , we can remove the data type  
(a)-> sop(a);
we can remove the brackets as well since only one parameter
A -> sop(a);
```
6. Similar to method body lambda expression body also can contain multiple statements. If more
than one statements present then we have to enclose inside within curly braces. If one statement
present then curly braces are optional.

7. Once we write lambda expression we can call that expression just like a method, for this
functional interfaces are required.

# Functional Interfaces

If an interface contain only one abstract method, such type of interfaces are called functional
interfaces and the method is called functional method or single abstract method (SAM).

Ex:

1) Runnable -> It contains only run() method
2) Comparable -> It contains only compareTo() method
3) ActionListener -> It contains only actionPerformed()
4) Callable -> It contains only call() method

Inside functional interface in addition to single Abstract method (SAM) we write any number of
default and static methods.

In Java 8, Sun Micro System introduced @Functional Interface annotation to specify that the interface
is Functional Interface.

```java
@Functional Interface
Interface Interf { 
public void m1();
 }
```

Inside Functional Interface we can take only one abstract method, if we take more than one abstract
method then compiler raise an error message that is called we will get compilation error.



# Streams

>To process objects of the collection, in 1.8 version Streams concept introduced

**What is the differences between Java.util.streams and Java.io streams?**

java.util streams meant for processing objects from the collection. Ie, it represents a stream of objects
from the collection but Java.io streams meant for processing binary and character data with respect to
file. i.e it represents stream of binary data or character data from the file .hence Java.io streams and
Java.util streams both are different.

**What is the difference between collection and stream?**

- If we want to represent a group of individual objects as a single entity then We should go for
collection.
- If we want to process a group of objects from the collection then we should go for streams.
- We can create a stream object to the collection by using stream() method of Collection interface.
stream() method is a default method added to the Collection in 1.8 version.
```java
List<Person> list = new ArrayList();
Stream = list.stream();
```
Stream is an interface present in java.util.stream. Once we got the stream, by using that we can
process objects of that collection.

**There are different methods available in Streams:**

We can configure either by using **filter** mechanism or by using **map** mechanism.

**Filtering:**

We can configure a filter to filter elements from the collection based on some boolean condition by using filter()method of Stream interface.

```java
public Stream filter(Predicate<T> t)
 ```
 
here **(Predicate<T > t )** can be a boolean valued function/lambda expression

Example :

```java
Stream s = c.stream();
Stream s1 = s.filter(i -> i%2==0);
```

Hence to filter elements of collection based on some Boolean condition we should go for filter()
method.

**Mapping:**

If we want to create a separate new object, for every object present in the collection based on our
requirement then we should go for map() method of Stream interface.

```java
public Stream map (Function f);
```
  
  
                     |
                     ---------it can be lamba expression also
                     
Example :

```java
Stream s = c.stream();
 Stream s1 = s.map(i-> i+10);
 ```

**flatMap()**

If you have a stream where every element contains its own sequence of elements and you want to create a stream of these inner elements, you should use the flatMap() method:

```java
List<Detail> details = new ArrayList<>();
details.add(new Detail());
Stream<String> stream
  = details.stream().flatMap(detail -> detail.getParts().stream());
  ```
  
In this example, we have a list of elements of type Detail. The Detail class contains a field PARTS, which is a List<String>. With the help of the flatMap() method every element from field PARTS will be extracted and added to the new resulting stream. After that, the initial Stream<Detail> will be lost.

**Reduction**

Stream API allows reducing a sequence of elements to some value according to a specified function with the help of the reduce() method of the type Stream. This method takes two parameters: first – start value, second – an accumulator function.

Imagine that you have a List<Integer> and you want to have a sum of all these elements and some initial Integer (in this example 23). So, you can run the following code and result will be 26 (23 + 1 + 1 + 1).
 
 ```java
 List<Integer> integers = Arrays.asList(1, 1, 1);
Integer reduced = integers.stream().reduce(23, (a, b) -> a + b);

 ```

**collect() method**
This method collects the elements from the stream and adding to the specified to the collection
indicated (specified) by argument.

```java
ArrayList<Integer> l1 = new ArrayList<Integer>();
 for(inti=0; i<=10; i++) {
 l1.add(i);
 }
System.out.println(l1);
 List<Integer> l2 = l1.stream().filter(i -> i%2==0).collect(Collectors.toList());
```

**Collecting**

The reduction can also be provided by the collect() method of type Stream. This operation is very handy in case of converting a stream to a Collection or a Map and representing a stream in form of a single string. There is a utility class Collectors which provide a solution for almost all typical collecting operations. For some, not trivial tasks, a custom Collector can be created.

```java
List<String> resultList 
  = list.stream().map(element -> element.toUpperCase()).collect(Collectors.toList());
```
This code uses the terminal collect() operation to reduce a Stream<String> to the List<String>.


**count()method**
This method returns number of elements present in the stream.

```java
long count = l.stream().filter(s ->s.length()==5).count();
sop(“The number of 5 length strings is:”+count);
```
**sorted()method**
If we sort the elements present inside stream then we should go for sorted() method.
the sorting can either default natural sorting order or customized sorting order specified by
comparator.
- sorted()- default natural sorting order
- sorted(Comparator c)-customized sorting order.

```java
List<String> l3=l.stream().sorted().collect(Collectors.toList());
sop(“according to default natural sorting order:”+l3);

List<String> l4=l.stream().sorted((s1,s2) -> -s1.compareTo(s2)).collect(Collectors.toList());
sop(“according to customized sorting order:”+l4);
```
**min() and max() methods**

- min(Comparator c) : returns minimum value according to specified comparator.
- max(Comparator c) : returns maximum value according to specified comparator.

```java
String min=l.stream().min((s1,s2) -> s1.compareTo(s2)).get();
sop(“minimum value is:”+min);

String max=l.stream().max((s1,s2) -> s1.compareTo(s2)).get();
sop(“maximum value is:”+max);
```
**forEach() method**

This method will not return anything.This method will take lambda expression as argument and apply that lambda expression for each element present in the stream.


**Convert Stream into Array using toArray() method**
We can use toArray() method to copy elements present in the stream into specified array
```java
Integer[] ir = l1.stream().toArray(Integer[] :: new);
for(Integer i: ir) {
 sop(i);
 }
 ```
